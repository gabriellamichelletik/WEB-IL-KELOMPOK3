<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">Integrated Learning Project, also known as ILP, is a project that provides students of Saint Ursula Junior High
        School Jakarta with real-world experience in teamwork, creativity, and entrepreneurship. For the 9th graders,
        students are required to create a booth and organize a bazaar, where various products are developed, marketed,
        and sold. Through this experience, students were given the opportunity to apply their knowledge from multiple
        subjects, such as social studies, mathematics, arts, science, and many more. Behind every successful business,
        there is always hard work and determination. <b> Countless preparations were done to ensure the success of the
            bazaar. </b> We’ve done everything from planning and building concepts, to carrying out the bazaar and
        making all the reports needed.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">We started off this project by building our store’s concept. After lots of brainstorming and decision making, we
        came to a conclusion and decided to name our store ‘Wara Wiri’. We focused on things that related to Jawa, a
        region in Indonesia filled with tradition, culture, and diversity. We also decided that our main focus was to
        build a store that was welcoming and friendly. Other than that, our store’s concept was also mildly inspired by
        Indonesia’s local and one-of-a-kind ‘warung’. <b> Our booth mascot, Wiri, a Javanese Eagle, was also chosen.</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">Next, we planned our products. This was the first challenge we had to face, because we had to consider a lot of
        things in choosing products. In the end, we figured it out, from the food, beverages, and products. We picked
        trendy yet practical products, mainly targeting teenagers. <b> The expenses were also carefully considered, and
            prices were decided based on what seemed fair and attractive to customers. </b> After finalizing our products
                and prices, we ended up changing a few things and made some updates. We cut back some food products
                because they weren’t relevant, and the biotechnology product was completely changed. We also did some
                minor changes to our PPKN product. Later on, we secured our product list, and afterwards sorted out
                packaging and stock. During this process, we also had to juggle preparations and rehearsals for a show
                we had to carry out. The show consisted of a musical drama and a dance recital. <b> Afterwards, several
                    food and beverage products were tested, and experiments were conducted for better results.</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">As for our booth decorations, we executed it according to the original plan. While making the booth, there were
        some minor challenges, but we went through all of them. First, we had a tight schedule so we had to work really
        quickly while maintaining the quality of our booth. Second, the paint we originally bought didn’t work as well
        as we thought it would. But, some parts of it still could be used. Other than that, we also replaced the paint
        and bought another set of paints. <b>Lights and tulle fabric were also added to enhance our booth.</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">To ensure and boost our sales, we did promotional campaigns through social media. <b>An Instagram account was
            created, and various promotional materials were posted, including videos, posters, and Instagram stories.</b>
                We posted Instagram stories quite consistently to update our customers. Pre-orders were also opened to
                ensure early sales. We also shared information about our Pre-Order and bazaar through Whatsapp to family
                and friends. <b>Our promotional activities went quite well, since no major complications were
                    encountered during the promotional activities and booth preparation.</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">On the day of the bazaar, our team worked collaboratively to prepare the booth. <b>The decorations were set up,
            and the products were arranged to attract customers.</b> Despite the booth being located at the far end of
                the venue, it still managed to draw many visitors. <b>Challenges were encountered, such as limited
                    space, unexpected product demand, and running out of ice for beverages.</b> Nevertheless, our team
                        members quickly adapted, and solutions were found to maintain smooth operations. Despite the
                        heat and uncomfortable conditions, we were relieved that it was crowded. <b>Most of the products
                            were sold out before the event concluded.</b> But, we still had 2 products left. A few of our
                                team members ended up strolling around the school area to find customers and to sell out
                                our products. In the end, all our products were sold out. At around 3 o’clock, we
                                started cleaning and tidying up our booth. We took down our booth decorations, put back
                                all the properties, and cleared and cleaned our table and area.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" class="isi hidden">Through this project, valuable lessons in business management, teamwork, and problem-solving were learned.
        <b>Collaboration was strengthened, and critical thinking was developed as students navigated the complexities of
            running a business.</b> We also learned that success doesn’t come easily, and we became even more certain
                that nothing good can come in an instant. We surely also learned that teamwork truly does make the dream
                work. All of the struggles we have gone through as a team and all of the efforts we had done as a team
                did not come to a waste.</p>
